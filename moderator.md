# Get Involved at MinneQ

MinneQ was born out of a desire to give back to the Minneapolis-St. Paul LGBTQ+ community. Everyone involved in MinneQ is an unpaid volunteer, and chooses to give their free time in service to the group. There are multiple ways to get involved as more than just a Member. 

## MinneQ Moderator

### Responsibilities

There are a lot of pieces that go into running MinneQ. Depending on the size of the team, each Moderator may be involved in a little of everything, or duties may be more delegated. Each Moderator should know and be capable of everything listed here, unless otherwise specified. 

#### Operations 
* Maintaining an updated inventory of supplies (plates, cutlery, drinks, etc) and ensuring that any necessary replenishment occurs before each event.
* Ensuring that all supplies arrive at the event at the beginning of setup and are all reassembled and stored at the end of a party.
* Ensuring the successful set up and tear down of all events, including coordinating with Host and assigning Helpers for specific tasks.
* Handling public and private event communications through Discord and the MinneQ website
* Maintaining the Treasury. This job is handled by one person; they are responsible for keeping an accurate log of spending and balance, paying out purchases in a timely manner

#### Technology
* Maintaining and updating the website, the Discord, and any applications used for organization operations. This job may fall to one person who is particularly experienced with web development, but it is not expected to. 
* Monitoring any policy or technology changes made by external websites or applications used by the organization and updating procedure accordingly.

#### Outreach and Education
* Designating community partners to benefit from fundraising and volunteer activities.
* Connecting with local businesses and orgs for events that take place in their spaces and require reservations.
* Connecting membership with resources, both to individuals and the group at large.
* Providing mentorship to Moderators with less seniority.

#### Communications
* Handling all public facing and sensitive organization communications. 
* Responding to all tickets in a timely manner. Member conflict tickets must be reviewed by multiple (or all) Moderators. All other tickets may be handled by a single Moderator. 
* Reviewing and updating the Code of Conduct annually.
* Creating official updates to the Discord and/or website. 
* Writing and publishing any new governance policies.
* Culture setting within the group and communicating culture to the community.

#### Public Events
* Establish safety and cultural norms. Be mindful of volume and dress.
* Engaging with new members and completing "vibe checks"

#### Private Events
* Ensuring that the party set up and tear down is completed and is low stress for the party hosts.
* Arriving early for set up/staying late to tear down.
* Creating the safest possible environment. This includes watching the space/members, verifying identity of everyone who attends, providing tours of the space, and making the house rules known to everyone in advance of the event. 

### Knowledge, Skills, Personality

MinneQ Leadership seeks individuals who, above all else, can respond with compassion and curiosity during difficult times. We are responsible for setting the culture, handling member conflicts, and modeling accountability to our community. We look for people who show up with enthusiasm, but this need not mean extroverts. 

There are many skills that are utilized by Moderators, but it is not expected nor required that an applicant will have any/all of those skills upon applying. One of the best ways to become a leader is by simply doing. A major piece of being a Moderator is being able to mentor those with less seniority, and train them in on the hard and soft skills required. The goal with the Moderator Team is to never be fully reliant on one person to complete a task--redundancy is key, for both the current Moderators' time/mental capacity, and the longevity of the group. 

Things that are NOT required to become a MinneQ Mod:
* Public speaking
* Confidence--both speaking with confidence to people, and feeling confident in decisions
* Leadership experience
* Event planning
* Logistics
* Web development
* Knowledge of MinneQ procedures

Things that ARE required to become a MinneQ Mod:
* Compassion
* Empathy
* A desire to give back

### Time Commitment

Moderators are unpaid volunteers. While it is expected this takes a priority in your life, it should not be the top priority. Moderators are encouraged to take breaks as needed for their mental health and well being. MinneQ should not come at a cost to your job and personal relationships. 

At minimum, Moderators are asked to "check in" at least once a day. This can be as simple as catching up on any conversations in Mod Chat and reviewing any new tickets. Moderators should also be active on Discord and help to generate conversation. 

Depending on the week, Moderators may spend 5-15 hours towards MinneQ (remember that some events run six hours, plus time before and after). Moderators are allowed and encouraged to enjoy the group they are creating--they might only work one hour of a six hour event.
