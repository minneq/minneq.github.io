# Hosting with MinneQ

In order to hold private events, we require hosts. Here, "host" refers to the noun of someone who owns, lives at, or controls property, and not to the verb of facilitating online or in-person events. 

## Hosting Agreement

The Moderators of MinneQ endeavor to make hosting as stress-free of an event as possible. MinneQ will create a customized Hosting Agreement with each host. This agreement lays out the expectations MinneQ has of our hosts, and the expectations the hosts has of MinneQ. It will also outline specific uses of the property and answer specific questions about event logistics. 

These agreements are not made public, but are available to the Host and MinneQ leadership at all times. 

The host will have a private Discord channel with Leadership where they can coordinate events, ask questions, and express concerns. 

### Example Hosting Agreement

#### MinneQ Expectations
* The Host will have the property clean and clear of clutter one hour before events start.
* The Host will ensure there is a safe and accessible path to the front door (no snow/ice).
* The Host's pet(s) must be well behaved. If they cause an issue, MinneQ will ask the Host to corral the pet(s) in a designated area of the property.
* MinneQ expects the Host to hold at least one event/quarter (three months), but the Host may choose to hold as many as they wish. 

#### Host Expectations
* MinneQ will arrive no earlier than one hour before the event to set up.
* MinneQ will be responsible for all set up and tear down of events, and will leave the property as they arrived.
* MinneQ is responsible for curating the guest list and managing any issues with Members.
* The Host expects to be notified of any incidents that take place at their property.
* The hosting fee is $100/6 hour event. It must be paid by MinneQ in the week following the event.
* MinneQ will give a minimum one month notice before requesting the use of the property. The Host may offer the use of their property with a minimum 2 weeks notice. 

#### Use of Space
* The oven, toaster oven, and microwave may all be used.
* The bonfire pit in the backyard may be used, weather permitting. Anyone outside must be dressed to not draw attention to the house.
* The bedrooms and offices are off limits.
* Two bathrooms available: powder room off kitchen, bathroom in basement.
* Absolutely no smoking indoors. Designated area is on the driveway, opposite side of the front door.
* No shoes in the house; there are shoe racks at the front door.

## Types of Private Events

The sky is the limit when it comes to private events! Here's some ideas that can be mix and matched:
* Backyard BBQ/grill out
* Bonfire
* Movie night
* Potlucks
* Events with a provided meal (brunch, taco bar, etc)
