# MinneQ Membership

To become a MinneQ Member, simply attend any of our public [events](/events) and speak with a Moderator. We welcome anyone who aligns with our [mission and values](/mission_and_values). 

## Joining the Discord

When joining our Discord server, you will be prompted with an application. There are two questions, How did you find MinneQ?, and What interests you about MinneQ? You will also certify to having read our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct). Applications are checked at least once a day by Leadership. When your application is approved, Discord will give a message such as "congrats, you are now a member of MinneQ!" **This is not the same as becoming a MinneQ Member.**

We recommend anyone interested in becoming a member join the Discord and complete the application before attending a public event--we will not be able to process your application at an event. 

## Meeting a Moderator

When meeting a Moderator, we will complete our "Vibe Check", which is a fancy way to say we are interested in getting to know who you are. We try to make sure to meet any faces we don't recognize, but please tell us if you are new and looking to become a member.
