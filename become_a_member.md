# MinneQ Membership

To become a MinneQ Member, simply attend any of our public events and speak with a Moderator. We welcome anyone who aligns with our [mission and values](/mission_and_values). Anyone who wishes to become a Member should join our Discord--all membership and event registrations are managed through the server. 

## Meeting a Moderator

When meeting a Moderator, we are interested in getting to know who you are and why you are interested in joining MinneQ. This is called the "Vibe Check"; we require this step to be completed before attending our private events for liability reasons.
