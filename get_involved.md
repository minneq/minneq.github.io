# Get Involved at MinneQ

MinneQ was born out of a desire to give back to the Minneapolis-St. Paul LGBTQ+ community. Everyone involved in MinneQ is an unpaid volunteer, and chooses to give their free time in service to the group. There are multiple ways to get involved as more than just a Member.

## Moderators

Moderators are responsible for the primary management of the group. To learn more about becoming a Moderator and access the application, visit: <Become a Moderator> 

## Helpers

Helpers are a significantly abridged role compared to Moderators. These individuals can help with anything that does not involved MinneQ logistics or moderation. We invite their help to plan and run events, create engagement in the server, and answer questions from newcomers. The time commitment for MinneQ Helper is 1-5 hours per week.

## Hosts

MinneQ cannot hold private events without Hosts. To learn more about becoming a host and access the application, visit: <Become a Host>
