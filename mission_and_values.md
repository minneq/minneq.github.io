# Mission Statement
Our mission at MinneQ is to create a Queer, sober third-space based in the Twin Cities. We host public and private events, as well as an online social space, that are 18+ and catered towards, but not limited to, adults under 40. We operate in service to our community and are inclusive to all genders, sexualities, and bodies.

# Value Statement
Our values are the guiding principles for our organizational decisions; we believe that serving our values is how to best protect and maintain our group and community. Complex groups are often faced with decisions that may challenge commitment to their values, and so we pledge to prioritize our values, harm reduction, and community safety over claimed best interests of the group itself. This is not out of neglect for the sustained longevity of the group, but because we believe that the best interests of the group itself can only be served by adhering to and prioritizing our values.

MinneQ shall make its membership, leadership, and policy decisions, host community gatherings, and organize private parties that are accountable to these values. Additionally, leadership commits to developing and hosting educational opportunities for our membership, raising funds and organizing volunteer opportunities for like-minded groups, modeling consent-forward and social justice-informed administration, and engaging in community outreach and service. At MinneQ, we believe,

* Queer sober third spaces are needed and lacking
* Queer identities and expression are a form of self expression and a form of resistance
* All bodies are good bodies, and all deserve respect
* Trans rights are human rights
* HRT is healthcare
* Abortion is healthcare
* Trans women are women
* Trans men are men
* Non-binary identities are valid
* Black lives matter
* White supremacy is violence
* Queer love, sex, and family are real, needed, and important
* Sex work is real work
* Kink and slut shaming hurt us all
* No human is illegal
* Accessibility benefits everyone
* Science is real
* Climate change is happening
* We believe survivors, every time
* Community safety and harm reduction are guiding principles for our actions and decisions
