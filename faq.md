# Frequently Asked Questions

## MinneQ General Questions
  
#### Q: I’m cisgender and straight. Is it okay if I join MinneQ?
  
A: We welcome anyone who believes in the Mission and Value Statements of MinneQ, regardless of orientation. MinneQ is explicitly a Queer group, but we do not gate-keep the space behind a required identity. 

#### Q: There’s a lot of different roles I see. What do they all mean? 

A: MinneQ Board: The Board is responsible for the long-term management of the group. 

MinneQ Moderators: These people run the group, organize events, handle member conflicts, and more.

Collectively, Board Members and Moderators are referred to as “MinneQ Leadership”. There are some people who are both Board and Moderators, but they can be independent roles as well. 

MinneQ Helpers: these are people who are invested in our group and choose to help us out. There are no special privileges to becoming a Helper, but we greatly appreciate the help of those who choose to give back. 

MinneQ Members: Members have attended an in person event and met with Leadership, and are now welcome to attend private events. 

Newcomer: This is someone who has recently joined our server and has yet to meet Leadership at an event. 

#### Q: How can I get involved to do more? 

A: We are still building MinneQ. Stay tuned for more information! 

## Conflict/Member Issue Tickets

#### Q: Someone in MinneQ is making me uncomfortable.
A: MinneQ takes these matters very seriously. Please open a Member issue/conflict ticket. These are the most difficult tickets we handle, and it may take some time before we have a resolution. 

Upon receiving your ticket, we will confirm that we have received it and ask any followup questions we have. We are not HR or a government agency--our focus is not on determining a factual truth, but on restoring safety to you and the rest of the community. Sometimes this restoration will involve removing someone from our space, but other times it may include education with the individual. 

#### Q: I have a thing I want to talk to Mods about, but it doesn't feel worth creating a conflict. It's not a big deal, right?

A: If you are uncomfortable about something, there's a good chance that someone else is, too. One person bringing us a small incident is unlikely to result in a ban of another member. A general rule of thumb: once is an accident, twice is negligence, and thrice is malicious. Your report of a "small issue" could lead us to a pattern of behavior that is not tolerated in MinneQ. 

<ins> We absolutely need the members of MinneQ to come forward whenever they experience a problem, no matter how small.</ins>

#### Q: I just broke up with my partner who is also a member of MinneQ. What happens now?

A: First off, we're sorry to hear that. This will be a challenging adjustment period for you both, and we encourage you both to stay away from MinneQ events for a month or two. 

MinneQ Leadership will not intervene or mediate your breakup. However, you are still welcome to contact us for some Big Sibling Advice and we'll do our best to help you out.

Logistically, it is your responsibility to arrange how the two of you will handle events going forward if you do not wish to cross paths, such as alternating even/odd months.

## ID Check and related questions</h2></summary>

#### Q: I'm trans and my ID is old and doesn't match my appearance well.

A: MinneQ by our very nature is a Queer group. We understand IDs can be out of date, and that sharing an old ID pic feels vulnerable. You may wait to show your ID at an in person event if you choose, but recognize that this will limit your server access until that is completed. 

#### Q: Is this the same as becoming a MinneQ Member?

A: We require an ID check as this is an 18+ space and community. If you wait to complete the ID check until an in person event, these two steps will be done at the same time, but they are different processes.

## Event related questions

#### Q: What is your vaccination and/or masking policy?

A: We do not require our members to mask at events, and instead focus on a culture of prevention through vaccinations and distancing while symptomatic. We cannot require proof of vaccinations as it is not readily provided. We strongly recommend everyone be vaccinated for COVID-19, the flu, and any other vaccinations recommended by your healthcare provider.

If you are experiencing infectious illness symptoms of any kind, even (and especially) if it’s “just a cold”, please do not attend MinneQ events. 

You are welcome to wear a mask if you choose and MinneQ has basic surgical masks available. 

#### Q: I can come early to help set up!

A: That's really nice of you, but please ask a moderator first. We appreciate the help, but sometimes end up with a "too many cooks" situation. If you are interested in helping out on a formal basis, you should look into becoming a MinneQ Helper!

#### Q: I use [insert drug here] to manage my chronic pain and/or mental health. Can I take it at MinneQ events?

A: MinneQ is a sober group. This means that we do not allow alcohol or other recreational drugs at private events. 

Medicinal usage is a complex topic that is going to vary from one individual to the next, so we aren’t eager to create a blanket policy on the issue. Generally, if you have a prescription and your usage does not impact others, you are welcome to take whatever you need. If you have questions beyond this, please open a ticket to discuss your situation with Leadership.

#### Q: What should I bring to the potluck?

A: The key to a good potluck is to have a nice cross-section of meals, snacks/appetizers, desserts and an assortment of flavors for each of those. People sometimes feel guilty for “only grabbing a bag of chips”, but that is equally important to a good potluck as pizza, fried chicken, or a salad. Please bring whatever you feel comfortable providing, and do not spend more than you are able.

Soda, sparkling water, and bottled water are provided. 

Here's some reminders about our potlucks: 
* If you are bringing something that is served hot, please have a way to keep it hot for the duration of the event (a crockpot, sterno, etc).
* We ask that all homemade foods have a list of ingredients/any potential allergens/other things people should know.
* No need to label store bought products if they are in the original packaging.
* Aim to feed 5-20. More niche options (like a curry or pasta) won't attract everyone the way a baked dessert will. Attendees will also be dishing up smaller portions so a meal designed to feed 6 at home might feed 12-15 at a party.
* If your food is served in pieces, please pre-cut serving sizes.
* Please take your leftovers home!

Easy store bought ideas: 
* Veggie/fruit trays
* Meat/cheese/crackers
* Fried/rotisserie chicken
* Takeout pizza
* Salty snacks (chips, pretzels, popcorn)
* Sweets (cookies, brownies, cupcakes)

Homemade ideas: 
* Chili/soup
* Deviled eggs
* Homemade desserts
* Pinwheel roll ups
* Minnesota sushi
* A Minnesota salad made from either mayonaisse or Cool Whip
* Hot cocoa/apple cider/specialty drinks

#### Q: What happens if there’s a medical emergency?

A: If you believe someone at the party is experiencing a medical emergency, please alert MinneQ Leadership immediately. Members of Leadership are CPR/first responder certified and are capable of determining if further intervention is necessary. 

#### Q: I RSVP’d but now I can’t go!

A: Please open an event ticket to let us know! We understand that life happens and it’s not always predictable. As long as you inform us, we do not hold the cancel against you. Ghosting an invite will place you on the bottom of the priority list for future events.
