# MinneQ Membership

To become a MinneQ Member, simply attend any of our public events and speak with a Moderator. We welcome anyone who aligns with our [mission and values](/mission_and_values). Anyone who wishes to become a Member should join our Discord--all membership and event registrations are managed through the server. 

## Meeting a Moderator

When meeting a Moderator, we are interested in getting to know who you are and why you are interested in joining MinneQ. This is called the "Vibe Check"; we require this step to be completed before attending our private events for liability reasons. 

# MinneQ Events

We host a variety of events in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro. All events will be announced on Discord and here on our website. 

MinneQ is a "generalist" group, which means, while any given event may have a theme, we are primarily focused on providing a space to be social with other members of the group. 

Many members in the LGBTQ+ space have difficult relationships with their family members. One mission of ours is to provide a space to be with community on otherwise difficult days, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Thanksgiving, and more.

Our Members are welcome to suggest event ideas and/or help facillitate them. If you are interested in helping on a regular basis, check out our [Get Involved](/get_involved) page. 

## Public Events

Public events are open to anyone 18+. We do not require any registration to attend. Types of public events MinneQ hosts: 
* Community Days (casual hang out in private rooms of libraries)
* Art museum meet-ups
* Picnics and games in a park
* Group volunteering
* Craft circles
* Restaurant meetups
* Board game days

### Public Event Rules
* Please be cognizant of outing. When out as a group, we will be associated together, and we do not wish to draw extra attention or hatred towards our group. While one person might regularly wear fishnets to the grocery store and consider it normal, not everyone has that level of comfortability in their identity. General rule of thumb: leave the nightclub wear for a different time.
* Responsible alcohol consumption is allowed by attendees 21+ when purchased from a third party (i.e. a restaurant)

## Private Events

Our private events take place in personal homes and attendance is limited to MinneQ Members. 

To attend a private event, you must register using the link provided on the Discord for each event. Registering is not a guarantee to attendance. 

Types of private events MinneQ hosts: 
* Movie nights
* Potlucks
* Bonfires
* Sober New Years Eve

### Private Event Rules

* We are incredibly grateful to our hosts for allowing us into their homes. Respect of the property is of the utmost importance. Members will be held responsible for any damage caused through negligence or carelessness. 
* Please remember to dress casually for arrival/departure to not draw extra attention to our hostâ€™s. 
* We encourage carpooling to private events.
