# Glossary
Because of the nature of the Queer community, much of our language has developed in online spaces and is not necessarily "standardized". We have created this page to be a resource of definitions as we use them within MinneQ. If you think of something we are missing that belongs on this page, submit a ticket on Discord to let us know!

### Romantic and/or Sexual Orientations 
There are criticisms that gay/lesbian as labels are not inclusive towards trans and non-binary identities. Some individuals prefer these alternatives (below) as being more inclusive because they do not define the gender of the individual using the label.

**Sapphic:** a woman attracted to women, but not exclusively (can also be bi/pan/queer).

**Achillean:** a man attracted to man, but not exclusively (can also be bi/pan/queer)

**Gynesexual:** attraction towards femininity. Heterosexual men and bisexual women are included here. 

**Androsexual:** attraction towards masculinity. Heterosexual women and bisexual men are included here.

**Ceterosexual/skoliosexual:** attraction towards non-binary/androgyny

### Relationship Labels
There are many different labels for relationship configurations. Each of these has different connotations, but none are more correct than than any other. 

**Monogamous:** An individual who has only one partner. 

**Polyamorous:** An individual who has chosen to seek more than one partner in their life to fulfill physical/emotional/sexual needs. 

**Polysaturated:** An individual who is poly and considers themselves "full" on partners. They may be maxed on what they can emotionally take on, capped on the amount of time they can give, or simply feel all their physical/emotional/sexual needs are met. 

**Open relationship:** a relationship in which both partners agree that each may have sexual relations with others, but typically limiting emotional connections

**Monogamish:** An individual who is primarily monogamous, but with the consent of their partner, seeks out sexual encounters with others. 

**Kitchen-table poly:** a style of polyamorous relationship where all partners and metamours (partners' partners) strive to have close, friendly, and even familial relationships with each other. 

**Closed poly/poly fidelity:** a type of polyamorous relationship where a group of three or more people agree to be romantically and/or sexually exclusive with each other, forming a closed circle. 

**Relationship anarchy:** a relationship style that challenges traditional relationship norms and expectations by emphasizing individual autonomy and rejects hierarchical structures within relationships. 

#### Polyamory is not for everyone. 
Polyamorous relationships are more common within the Queer community as individuals are often more willing to reject societal norms. This does not mean polyamory is a good fit for everyone, nor that everyone should embrace it as a practice. If it works for you (and your partner), that is wonderful! 

#### Polyamory is not cheating. 
Healthy polyamory requires all individuals involved are aware of the nature of the relationship dynamics at play and all other partners. This does not mean that one individual knows or is aware of the intimate details of their partners relationships, but they should be made aware when their partner begins a new sexual relationship, as this changes their STI risk, among other things. 

#### Cheating can still happen in polyamory. 
Being poly does not give license to start new relationships without informing and obtaining affirmative consent from current partners regarding the nature of them. 

The nature of your relationship dynamic is up to you and any partners you have, and there is no single correct way, as long as everyone has informed consent of the situation.
