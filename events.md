# MinneQ Events

We host a variety of events in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro. All events will be announced on Discord and here on our website. 

Our Members are welcome to suggest event ideas and/or help facillitate them. If you are interested in helping on a regular basis, check out our [Get Involved](/get_involved) page. 

MinneQ is a "generalist" group, which means, while any given event may have a theme, we are primarily focused on providing a space to be social with other members of the group. 

Many members in the LGBTQ+ space have difficult relationships with their family members. One mission of ours is to provide a space to be with community on otherwise difficult days, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Thanksgiving, and more.
