# MinneQ Events

We host a variety of events in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro. All events will be announced on Discord and here on our website. 

MinneQ is a "generalist" group, which means, while any given event may have a theme, we are primarily focused on providing a space to be social with other members of the group. 

Many members in the LGBTQ+ space have difficult relationships with their family members. One mission of ours is to provide a space to be with community on otherwise difficult days, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Thanksgiving, and more.

Our Members are welcome to suggest event ideas and/or help facillitate them. If you are interested in helping on a regular basis, check out our [Get Involved](/get_involved) page.

## Public Events

Public events are open to anyone 18+. We do not require any registration to attend. Types of public events MinneQ hosts: 
* Community Days (casual hang out in private rooms of libraries)
* Art museum meet-ups
* Picnics and games in a park
* Group volunteering
* Craft circles
* Restaurant meetups
* Board game days

### Attendance

We do not require any RSVPs to attend our public events. However, it is still nice to have an indication of how many people will be attending. Using a reaction-role system (similar to that for #roles), using a reaction on the event announcement will add you to the channel for that event. 

The event channel serves as a place for us to share time/date/location and any other information specific to the event. Members are encouraged to use the channel to discuss the event, coordinate carpools, ask any questions, and express general excitement for the event. 

In the event of urgent updates (weather, last minute cancelation, etc), we will use an @here ping. **Please do not have these turned off for the server, or you may miss these updates.** 

Attending a public event is the only way to become a MinneQ Member. Learn more about the process at [Become a Member](/become_a_member)

### Rules
* Please be cognizant of outing. When out as a group, we will be associated together, and we do not wish to draw extra attention or hatred towards our group. While one person might regularly wear fishnets to the grocery store and consider it normal, not everyone has that level of comfortability in their identity. General rule of thumb: leave the nightclub wear for a different time.
* Responsible alcohol consumption is allowed by attendees 21+ when purchased from a third party (i.e. a restaurant)
* Our Code of Conduct and all rules therein apply at all events.

## Private Events

Our private events take place in personal homes and attendance is limited to MinneQ Members. 

To attend a private event, you must register using the link provided on the Discord for each event. Registering is not a guarantee to attendance. 

Types of private events MinneQ hosts: 
* Movie nights
* Potlucks
* Bonfires
* Sober New Years Eve

### Registration/Attendance

Our private events follow a registration then invite system. When we announce an private event, we will post the registration link in #members-only-events on our Discord. All attendees register on their own; there is an open field to list if you are planning to attend with anyone else (this allows us to ensure we do not split up groups). Registering to attend an event does not guarantee admittance.  

Before the event, we will send out the invite information via Discord. Everyone attending will be added to a unique channel via an @here ping. **Do not have these turned off for the server, or you may not see your invites.** We do not require any secondary form of communication if you plan to attend. If you cannot attend, please open an event ticket to let us know. Anyone who registers, is invited, and does not attend is considered a ghost, and will be put on the bottom of the priority list for future events. 

The private event channel serves as a place for us to share time/date/location and any other information specific to the event. Members are encouraged to use the channel to discuss the event, coordinate carpools, ask any questions, and express general excitement for the event. 

In the event of urgent updates (weather, last minute cancelation, etc), we will use an @here ping. **Again, do not have these disabled, or you may miss important information.** 

### Rules

* We are incredibly grateful to our hosts for allowing us into their homes. Respect of the property is of the utmost importance. Members will be held responsible for any damage caused through negligence or carelessness. 
* Please remember to dress casually for arrival/departure to not draw extra attention to our hostâ€™s. 
* We encourage carpooling to private events.
* Our Code of Conduct and all rules therein apply at all events.
* Hosts may have special rules designated for their house. These will be included in your invite email. Please read and familiarize yourself with them.
