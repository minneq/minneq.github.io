## Communication

### Contacting Moderators
The best way to contact Leadership is to open a ticket in #contact-us. Opening a ticket will create a private channel between you and Leadership. We handle a multitude of concerns/questions at MinneQ and endevor to answer your ticket with relative expediency. 

If your ticket is related to an issue with someone on MinneQ Leadership, you may DM the moderator you are most comfortable with. After the moderator receives your report, they will create a private channel with the remaining members of Leadership to discuss your concerns. 

Please review the FAQs on Discord for the related ticket options before opening a ticket. 

If not on Discord, you may contact MinneQ via our email, <minnequeer@gmail.com>.
