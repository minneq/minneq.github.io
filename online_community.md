# MinneQ's Online Community

Part of our Mission at MinneQ is to provide an online social space for our community. We've found that having a place to connect with the community outside of events that allows for deeper friendships to form, as well as a simple ease of having a contact method for anyone you've met at MinneQ. 

## [Join Our Discord]

When joining our Discord server, you will be prompted with an application. There are two questions, How did you find MinneQ?, and What interests you about MinneQ? You will also certify to having read our [Code of Conduct](/Code_of_Conduct). Applications are checked at least once a day by Leadership. When your application is approved, Discord will give a message such as “congrats, you are now a member of MinneQ!” **This is not the same as becoming a MinneQ Member.**

We recommend anyone interested in becoming a member join the Discord and complete the application before attending a public event–we will not be able to process your application at an event.

## Getting Around

Our Discord is fairly large, consisting of more than 30 channels across five main categories. Here's a brief rundown of them: 
#### Landing
In the landing, you'll find important group information, announcements, event notifications, and ways to contact Leadership. 

Head to #Roles to self-assign any labels you want on your profile. Head to #colors to select one that fits your personality.
#### MinneQ Main
Here you'll find general chat channels and three forum sections. Forums are a helpful way to have conversations that can be referenced easily later. 
* General Forums
  * Use for anytime you want a conversation to stay visible easier that does not fall into the other two forums. 
* Resources and Advice
  * "I need help finding a provider to get an ADHD diagnosis."
  * "Sex doesn't feel good, what am I doing wrong?" 
  * "[Insert cool nonprofit that I want to brag about]"
  * "I need to find a job. Is there anyone who would be willing to look at my resume?" 
  * "[Queer owned business is hiring!!]"
* Twin Cities Happenings
  * This forum is for posting events that are of interest to members of MinneQ that are not organized by MinneQ. You may also use this forum to organize an unofficial MinneQ meetup. Art festivals, local musicians, and more!
#### Pets and Animals
Come here to post your pets and show them off! 
#### Hobbies
These are great places to talk about things that you are interested in! If you think we're missing a channel, let us know in a ticket.
#### Gaming
Here's a place to chat about gaming of all kinds. We also have a "Looking for Group" forum for anyone who wants to create a regular game group to hang out with. 
#### Voice/Video chats
We have multiple channels available. You must complete the ID check before you can access these. We also have one room available for MinneQ Members only.
