# MinneQ: Coming soon!

## Hey, we're not ready yet. But we're excited to share some of our vision for this community:

* MinneQ (pronounced Mini-Q) is a Queer, sober third-space for individuals in the Twin Cities of Minnesota with in person events and an online social space.
* We host public and private events, as well as an online social space, that are 18+ and catered towards, but not limited to, adults under 40. We operate in service to our community and are inclusive to all genders, sexualities, and bodies.
* In person events: sober holidays with found-family, queer brunch, movie parties, craft days, game days (board, video, card), bonfires, potlucks/house parties, adventures to museums and zoos, trans clothing swaps, and so much more!
* This community is explicitly Queer, but not exclusively. We will never gate keep a Queer space because it only shuns away others from exploration.

## Our values: 
* Queer identities and expression are a form of self expression and a form of resistance 
* Queer sober third spaces are needed and lacking
* All bodies are good bodies, and all deserve respect 
* Trans rights are human rights
* HRT is healthcare
* Abortion is healthcare
* Trans women are women
* Trans men are men
* Non-binary identities are valid
* Black lives matter
* White supremacy is violence
* Queer love, sex, and family are real, needed, and important
* Sex work is real work
* Kink and slut shaming hurt us all
* No human is illegal
* Accessibility benefits everyone
* Science is real
* Climate change is happening 
* We believe survivors, every time
* Community safety and harm reduction are guiding principles for our actions and decisions
