# Code of Conduct and Membership Agreement
All Members, Helpers, Moderators, and Board of MinneQ are expected and required to uphold the Code of Conduct. The MinneQ Code of Conduct is to be followed in all MinneQ spaces, which includes the Discord server and all in-person events. 

Additionally, certain aspects of the MinneQ Code of Conduct are expected to be adhered to by everyone, even outside of MinneQ spaces. For example, if Leadership is informed that a member is posting sexist, racist, or transphobic comments in other online spaces, that person would be banned from MinneQ, regardless of those comments not occurring within MinneQ itself. The same can be said regarding outing, violations of consent, harassment, and bullying. 

## Impact versus Intent
While intentions of an action are important, we focus on the impact of actions. Harm can be caused without intent. During any conflict, our goal at MinneQ is harm reduction. “But I didn’t intend to” is not an excuse to harm caused to an individual. 

## Community standards and expectations

**Be respectful.** We believe that a commitment to trans rights, racial justice, gender equity, and sexual freedom helps determine the safety of communities. We are a progressive LGBTQ+ community. This is not a space to play “devil's advocate.”

**Respect the property of others.** Damage caused to anyone’s personal property through negligence or carelessness, including damage done to private event hosts’ property, will not be tolerated. The individual(s) responsible for and and all damages will be liable for cost of replacement/repair. 

**MinneQ is a safer space.** At MinneQ, we follow a “vote with your feet” policy. This means that if you don’t like a conversation that otherwise is not breaking the Code of Conduct, it is your responsibility to leave the area (digital or in person). However, be aware of these caveats: 
* You can ask individuals to reduce the volume.  
* If the conversation is digital, you can ask the conversation be threaded and/or spoiler tagged. 
* Conversations that go against the MinneQ values or Code of Conduct will not be permitted, ever. 

**Use content warnings.** This is an adults-only server with deeply rooted social-justice values, and we expect to see sensitive and potentially triggering topics being discussed. We do not shun these conversations away, but please be respectful of the impact that these conversations may have on others. If in person, please be aware of your volume and your surroundings. If online, please spoiler tag and/or thread the conversation. 

Topics to give this consideration include, but are not limited to, discussions of current political events, self-harm, suicide, transphobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, body shaming, or abuse.

**Be aware of outing.** Many of us are loud and proud everyday, but remember that there are some who cannot be for any number of reasons, including personal safety. Unless you know explicitly that it is okay to approach someone outside of MinneQ events, do not attempt to do so. Also remember that MinneQ is a safer space where individuals may share personal details–this does not mean they are willing to broadcast those details to the public. 

Additionally, outing includes: 
* Exposing someone’s medical or STI statuses.
* Tagging someone in pictures without permission, or posting pictures without express consent.
* Sharing the locations of Host homes or the names of our Hosts; sharing Host information.
* Outing someone for having once presented as a different gender identity without permission.
* Outing deadnames, or outing someone’s chosen name/pronouns in situations they are not out.

We also ask that individuals are cognizant of dress at public events. We do not wish to draw extra attention or hatred towards our group.  General rule of thumb: leave the nightclub wear for a different time.

**No cruising or personals.** MinneQ is not a place for hookups; do not join MinneQ or attend our events with the sole intention to date. This is a social group that is focused on community and friendship. You are not barred from dating within the MinneQ community–just don’t be a creep. 

**No unsolicited advertising or self-promotion.** This is not a place to advertise your Etsy shop, OnlyFans, GoFundMe, or social media links with the intent to gain followers. 
You are allowed, as an engaged member of the community, to share stuff you do when it is relevant. Table at a market? Awesome! Sharing your Instagram handle to show off more of your cosplay? Go for it! 

**Consent is mandatory.** At MinneQ, we practice affirmative consent for everything. Be cognizant of personal space and do not touch anyone or their property without permission.

**MinneQ is an 18+, sex and kink-positive space.** However, this is not a space for pornography, nudes, lewds, or erotic artwork. Everyone must complete the ID check to gain access to the full server. 

**MinneQ is a sober space.** This means that we do not allow alcohol or other recreational drugs at private events. Discussion of responsible legal recreational use is permitted. 

**Harassment or bullying of any kind is not permitted.** If you harass a Member or Moderator in person, in our online community, in personal communication, or on any social media, you are in violation of our community standards and consent policy. The situation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, up to and including removal of Member status and expulsion from the group. 

## MinneQ Membership Bans, Suspensions, and Disciplinary Measures
MinneQ Membership can be removed at any time by MinneQ Leadership, with or without explanation. MinneQ Members are bound by our Code of Conduct, Value Statement, cultural standards, and any specific directions given by Leadership. Violation of any of the aforementioned, or actions representing a danger or damage to our group members or group culture, may result in removal of MinneQ Member status, suspension from group activities, and other disciplinary measures. MinneQ is a private group, and membership status is entirely at the discretion of Leadership. MinneQ lacks the resources or capacity to perform investigations of wrongdoing, and instead make decisions rooted in a policy of harm reduction.
